Always as tough as nails and at the same time conveying true sentiments. It is fair to add that she also got many good parts during her long career, and this one is by far the least interesting.The title fits this movie very well. It is about desires, human desires I think everyone can understand. Actually, no one seems to be scheming in this movie, all characters act on impulse, everybody wants to be happy without hurting anybody else. The sad fact that this more often than not leads to complications makes for the dramatic content into which I will not go here.I liked what this movie has to say about youth, about maturing and about the necessity to compromise. The movie I associate most with this one is \n<mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: #aa9cfc; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">\n    Alfred Hitchcock's\n    <span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">PERSON</span>\n</mark>\n Shadow of a \n<mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: #7aecec; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">\n    Doubt\n    <span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">ORG</span>\n</mark>\n, it creates a similar atmosphere of idealized and at the same time caricatured \n<mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: #7aecec; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">\n    Small Town America\n    <span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">ORG</span>\n</mark>\n.

The whole thing makes for such a predictable movie that almost anyone will be able to figure out the &quot;surprise ending&quot; long before it comes.Right about here would be a good time to point out that the advertising campaign, centered on the idea that only children can see ghosts, has nothing to do with this movie. In fact, everyone can see the ghosts. The teenage daughter and mother characters certainly see them, even quite early in the movie. I'm sure that whomever was in charge of marketing came up with this campaign because the film needed a unique angle to have any box office appeal, which otherwise is entirely absent. Now you know, so don't be fooled! Perhaps what this movie lacks most of all is anything resembling chemistry between the actors. It simply isn't there. All of the interactions come across as awkwardly stilted. Coupled with the hackneyed story and ridiculous plot holes (just what is a guy who murdered his whole family doing still lurking around the small town where the murder happened, anyhow? Didn't anyone think to maybe arrest him?), it all adds up to a profoundly unsatisfying ghost flick that only manages to surprise anyone over \n<mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: #bfe1d9; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">\n    the age of ten\n    <span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">DATE</span>\n</mark>\n with cheap shots: loud noises, visual flashes, and anything short of a sheeted figure jumping out of a closet and yelling &quot;\n<mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: #aa9cfc; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">\n    Boo\n    <span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">PERSON</span>\n</mark>\n!&quot; All we get for our buck this time around is yet another poorly-made film about spirits attempting to warn people away from a house.

The plot is simplistic, but the dialogue is witty and the characters are likable (even the well bread suspected serial killer). While some may be disappointed when they realize this is not Match Point 2: Risk Addiction, I thought it was proof that Woody Allen is still fully in control of the style many of us have grown to love.This was the most I'd laughed at one of Woody's comedies in years (dare I say a decade?). While I've never been impressed with Scarlet Johanson, in this she managed to tone down her \"sexy\" image and jumped right into a average, but spirited young woman.This may not be the crown jewel of his career, but it was wittier than \"Devil Wears Prada\" and more interesting than \"Superman\" a great comedy to go see with friends.\"\n\n    ### Expected Output Format:\n    {\n      \"entities\": [\n        {\"text\": \"Entity Name\", \"label\": \"WORK_OF_ART/PERSON\"},\n      ],\n      \"sentiment\": \"Positive/Negative\"\n    }\n    \n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":21},{"cell_type":"code","source":"comparison_data = {\n    \"Method\": [\"spaCy (Small Model)\", \"LLM (Few-shot Prompting)\", \"Human (Gold Standard)\"],\n    \"Speed\": [\"High\", \"Medium\", \"Low\"],\n    \"Context Understanding\": [\"Limited (Statistical)\", \"High (Semantic)\", \"Highest\"],\n    \"Consistency\": [\"100%\", \"90-95%\", \"90%\"]\n}\n\ndf_comparison = pd.DataFrame(comparison_data)\ndisplay(df_comparison)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-12-29T20:00:00.252795Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-12-29T20:00:00.253050Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-12-29T20:00:00.261238Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-12-29T20:00:00.253030Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-12-29T20:00:00.260406Z"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"                     Method   Speed  Context Understanding Consistency\n0       spaCy (Small Model)    High  Limited (Statistical)        100%\n1  LLM (Few-shot Prompting)  Medium        High (Semantic)      90-95%\n2     Human (Gold Standard)     Low                Highest         90%","text/html":"<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>Method</th>\n      <th>Speed</th>\n      <th>Context Understanding</th>\n      <th>Consistency</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>spaCy (Small Model)</td>\n      <td>High</td>\n      <td>Limited (Statistical)</td>\n      <td>100%</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>LLM (Few-shot Prompting)</td>\n      <td>Medium</td>\n      <td>High (Semantic)</td>\n      <td>90-95%</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>Human (Gold Standard)</td>\n      <td>Low</td>\n      <td>Highest</td>\n      <td>90%</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":23},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null}]}
